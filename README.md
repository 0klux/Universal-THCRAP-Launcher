# Universal-THCRAP-Launcher
Originally planned as just a simple exercise project for myself, this program allows you to choose a patch configuration file and a game, and run it trough [thcrap](https://github.com/thpatch/thcrap) to start your favorite [Touhou](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki) games with your favorite patches!
