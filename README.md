# Universal-THCRAP-Launcher
Originally planned as just a simple exercise project for myself, this program allows you to choose a patch configuration file and a game, and run it trough [thcrap](https://github.com/thpatch/thcrap) to start your favorite [Touhou](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki) games with your favorite patches!
Hope you will find it useful.
To use it just put it alongside thcrap_loader.exe!

## Installation
 - Extract the files from `universal-thcrap-launcher.rar`.
 - Place the files next to `thcrap_configure.exe`.
 - Run `Universal THCRAP Launcher.exe`.
